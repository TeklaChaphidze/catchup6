        "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition 
        and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro 
        course and found it incredibly fun! The next 12 weeks were the best - and most grueling - time 
        of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers."
